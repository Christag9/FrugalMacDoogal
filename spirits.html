                <h3> Vodka</h3>
            Vodka is the most common distilled spirit found in cocktails and mixed drinks and it is essential to every bar. Its popularity comes from the general characteristic that it has no discernible or distinct flavor or smell and it is often clear. This allows the other ingredients of a drink to become the focal point.

             <h3> Tequila</h3>
            Few spirits are as shrouded in myth and mystery as tequilaâ€”and for good reason. This spicy and instantly recognizable Mexican spirit has been around for centuries, which is plenty of time for a few good tall tales to surface.
