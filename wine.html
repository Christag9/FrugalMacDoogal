                <h3>Rosé Wines</h3><p>Rosé happens when the skins of red grapes touch wine for only a short time. Where some red wines ferment for weeks at a time on red grape skins, rosé wines are stained red for just a few hours. The winemaker has complete control over the color of the wine, and removes the red grape skins when the wine reaches the perfect color rosé is born.</p></div>
